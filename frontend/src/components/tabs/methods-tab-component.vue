        <h4 class="title is-medium" id="linear_regression_help">Linear Regression</h4>
        <p>
            Linear regression is a statistical method used to predict a continuous numeric value based on one or more
            input features. It assumes a linear relationship between the inputs (independent variables) and the output
            (dependent variable). The model fits a straight line through the data by minimizing the difference between
            predicted and actual values, often using a method called least squares. The equation of a linear regression
            model looks like:
            <vue-mathjax
                :formula="'$$ y = \\beta_0 x_0+  \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2+ ...+\\beta_n x_n+ intercept $$'"></vue-mathjax>

            Here, y is the predicted value,(x_i)
            are the input features, and(β_i)
            are the learned coefficients. Linear regression is commonly used in scenarios like predicting house prices,
            exam scores, or sales revenue. It is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score,
            and assumes things like normally distributed errors and consistent variance across predictions.
        </p>
        <h4 class="title is-medium" id="logistic_regression_help">Logistic Regression</h4>
        <p>
            Logistic Regression is used when the output is categorical, especially for binary classification (e.g.,
            yes/no, 0/1). Instead of predicting a continuous value, it predicts the probability that an input belongs to
            a certain class. To do this, it uses the sigmoid function, which squashes any real number output into a
            range between 0 and 1:
            <vue-mathjax :formula="'$$ y= \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} $$'"></vue-mathjax>
            where
            z is the linear combination of inputs (same as in linear regression). If the resulting probability is
            greater than 0.5, the output is classified as 1; otherwise, it's classified as 0.
            If the probability is above a certain threshold (usually 0.5), the model classifies the input as one class;
            otherwise, it classifies it as the other. The output of the model represents the log-odds of the outcome,
            and logistic regression is evaluated using classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1
            score, and ROC-AUC. Though it shares structural similarity with linear regression, its purpose and behavior
            are quite different.

        <h4 class="title is-medium" id="polynomial_regression_help">Polynomial Regression</h4>
        <p>
            Polynomial regression is an extension of linear regression that models the relationship between the input
            variable
            𝑥
            x and the output variable
            𝑦
            y as an nth-degree polynomial. While linear regression fits a straight line, polynomial regression fits a
            curved line, which allows it to capture more complex, non-linear patterns in the data. The general form of
            the equation is:
            <vue-mathjax :formula="'$$ y = \\beta_0 +  \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2+ ...+\\beta_n x^n $$'"></vue-mathjax>
            Here, the model includes powers of the input variable (like
            𝑥^2, 𝑥^3, etc.) as additional features. For example, a second-degree polynomial (quadratic regression) can
            model
            U-shaped or inverted U-shaped curves. Polynomial regression is still considered a linear model in terms of
            the coefficients, but it allows for non-linear relationships between x and y. It can be very effective for
            modeling curved trends, but if the degree of the polynomial is too high, it
            can lead to overfitting, where the model fits the training data too closely and performs poorly on new data.

            (y) and (x ∣ y = 0) and (x|y = 1) are such that:

        <h4>Partial Dependence Plot</h4>
        <p>
            The partial dependence plot (short PDP or PD plot) shows the marginal effect one or two features have on the
            predicted outcome of a machine learning model. A partial dependence plot can show
            whether the relationship between the target and a feature is linear, monotonic or more complex. For example,
            when applied to a linear regression model, partial dependence plots always show a linear relationship.

            The partial dependence function for regression is defined as:
            <vue-mathjax :formula="'$$ f_s(x_s) = \\int{f(x_s,x_c)dP(x_c)}$$'"></vue-mathjax>
            The x<sub>s</sub>
            are the features for which the partial dependence function should be plotted and
            X<sub>c</sub>
            are the other features used in the machine learning model
            ^
            f
            , which are here treated as random variables. Usually, there are only one or two features in the set S. The
            feature(s) in S are those for which we want to know the effect on the prediction. The feature vectors
            X<sub>s</sub>
            and
            X<sub>c</sub>
            combined make up the total feature space x. Partial dependence works by marginalizing the machine learning
            model output over the distribution of the features in set C, so that the function shows the relationship
            between the features in set S we are interested in and the predicted outcome. By marginalizing over the
            other features, we get a function that depends only on features in S, interactions with other features
            included.

            The partial function
            ^
            f
            S
            is estimated by calculating averages in the training data, also known as Monte Carlo method:

            <vue-mathjax :formula="'$$ f_s(x_s) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{n = 1}^{n} f(x_s,x_c)$$'"></vue-mathjax>

            The partial function tells us for given value(s) of features S what the average marginal effect on the
            prediction is. In this formula,
            x
            (
            i
            )
            C
            are actual feature values from the dataset for the features in which we are not interested, and n is the
            number of instances in the dataset. An assumption of the PDP is that the features in C are not correlated
            with the features in S. If this assumption is violated, the averages calculated for the partial dependence
            plot will include data points that are very unlikely or even impossible (see disadvantages).

            For classification where the machine learning model outputs probabilities, the partial dependence plot
            displays the probability for a certain class given different values for feature(s) in S. An easy way to deal
            with multiple classes is to draw one line or plot per class.

            The partial dependence plot is a global method: The method considers all instances and gives a statement
            about the global relationship of a feature with the predicted outcome.
        </p>
        <h4>Categorical features</h4>
        <p>
            So far, we have only considered numerical features. For categorical features, the partial dependence is very
            easy to calculate. For each of the categories, we get a PDP estimate by forcing all data instances to have
            the same category. For example, if we look at the bike rental dataset and are interested in the partial
            dependence plot for the season, we get four numbers, one for each season. To compute the value for “summer”,
            we replace the season of all data instances with “summer” and average the predictions.
        </p>
        <h4>Permutation Feature Importance</h4>
        <p>
            Permutation feature importance is a powerful and intuitive method used to evaluate the impact of each
            feature on a machine learning model’s performance. After a model has been trained, this technique works by
            randomly shuffling the values of one feature at a time in the validation or test dataset. By doing so, the
            relationship between that feature and the target variable is disrupted, while all other features remain
            unchanged. The model is then used to make predictions on this altered dataset, and the drop in performance
            (measured by accuracy, F1 score, RMSE, or any other metric) is recorded. A large drop indicates that the
            feature was important to the model’s predictions, while a small or no change suggests that the feature had
            little influence. This method is model-agnostic, meaning it can be used with any type of machine learning
            algorithm, from decision trees to neural networks. However, one limitation is that it can be misleading when
            features are highly correlated, as the importance may be shared among multiple features, making individual
            effects harder to isolate.
