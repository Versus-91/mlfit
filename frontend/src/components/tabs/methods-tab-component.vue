            In a context of a binary classification, here are the main metrics that are important to track in order to
            assess the performance of the model.

                Confusion matrix: The confusion matrix is used to have a more complete picture when assessing the
                performance of a model. It is defined as follows:
            </li>
            <li>
                Main metrics: The following metrics are commonly used to assess the performance of classification
                models:
            </li>
            <li>
                The receiver operating curve, also noted ROC, is the plot of TPR versus FPR by varying the threshold.
                These metrics are are summed up in the table below:
            </li>
            <li>
                The area under the receiving operating curve, also noted AUC or AUROC, is the area below the ROC as

            The most commonly used method is called
            k-fold cross-validation and splits the training data into
            k folds to validate the model on one fold while training the model on the kâˆ’1 other folds, all of this
            k times. The error is then averaged over the k folds and is named cross-validation error.

            regularization: The regularization procedure aims at avoiding the model to overfit the data and thus deals

                Classification and Regression Trees (CART), commonly known as decision trees, can be represented as
                binary
                trees. They have the advantage to be very interpretable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Random forestIt is a tree-based technique that uses a high number of decision trees built out of
                randomly
                selected
                sets of features. Contrary to the simple decision tree, it is highly uninterpretable but its generally
                good
                performance makes it a popular algorithm.

                BoostingThe idea of boosting methods is to combine several weak learners to form a stronger one. The

                summed up in the table below:

                â€¢ High weights are put on errors to improve at the next boosting step
                â€¢ Known as Adaboost â€¢
                Weak learners are trained on residuals
                â€¢ Examples include XGBoost

        <h4 class="title is-medium" id="knn_help">(k)-nearest neighbors</h4>
        <p>
            (k)-nearest neighbors: The
            (k)-nearest neighbors algorithm, commonly known as
            (k)-NN, is a non-parametric approach where the response of a data point is determined by the nature of its
            (k) neighbors from the training set. It can be used in both classification and regression settings.
