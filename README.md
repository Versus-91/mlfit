# 🧠 ML Web Platform with HPC Integration

A web-based platform for building and executing machine learning pipelines with integrated tools for visualization, explainable AI, and dimensionality reduction. The system connects to TU Dresden’s HPC infrastructure for scalable computation on large datasets.

## 🚀 Features

- **Modular ML Pipelines**  
  Create, edit, and run pipelines for classification, regression, clustering, and preprocessing using an intuitive, no-code web interface.

- **Data Visualization**  
  Visual tools for exploring datasets and model results:
  - Scatter plots
  - Heatmaps
  - Decision boundaries
  - Correlation Cluster diagrams

- **Explainable AI (XAI)**  
  Built-in tools for model interpretability:
  - Permutation Feature Importance (PFI)
  - Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)
  - Feature importance visualizations

- **Dimensionality Reduction**  
  Supports multiple techniques for simplifying high-dimensional data:
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
  - Autoencoders

- **HPC Integration (TU Dresden)**  
  Offloads heavy computations to the TU Dresden HPC cluster, enabling efficient handling of large datasets.

- **User-Friendly Interface**  
  Web-based, no programming skills required. ideal for students, researchers, and data science practitioners.
